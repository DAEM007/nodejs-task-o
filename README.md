## Description

The mini shopping cart consists of two main constructor functions:

1. Product: This constructor creates a product with private properties `name` and `price`. It also provides methods to retrieve these properties.

2. ShoppingCart: This constructor creates a shopping cart with a private property `items` to store the added products. It offers methods to add and remove items, calculate the total price, and list the items in the cart.

## How it works
1. Create instances of Product using the Product constructor. Provide the product's name and price as arguments.

2. Create an instance of ShoppingCart using the ShoppingCart constructor.

3. Use the addItem method to add products to the shopping cart.

4. Use the removeItem method to remove products from the shopping cart.

5. Use the getTotal method to calculate and display the total price of items in the cart.

6. Use the getCartItems method to display the names and prices of items in the cart.
